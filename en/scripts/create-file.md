# Create File

The **Create File** command creates the specified file. It can also completely delete the content of the file.

%html.create-file%

**File Name**  
Specify the full or relative path to the file to be created. By default, if the file exists, the function does nothing.

**Truncate If File Exists**  
Click this checkbox if you want to truncate the file to zero size if the file already exists.
