# Bash

The **Bash** command executes the specified bash script. You must specify the script text, not the path to the bash file.

%html.bash%

**Bash Script**  
Specify the Bash script code that you want to execute.

**Wait until application finishes**  
Check this box if you want to wait for the bash script to finish. Otherwise, the next command will be executed right after the call to bash, without waiting for it to finish.
