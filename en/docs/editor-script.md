# Script

Each script consists of a sequence of commands that are executed one after another. Each command is also a script. Here you can add and change the commands of the current script. The Script tab is divided into two parts - on the left there is a list of commands and on the right there is a card with parameters of the current command. The script can contain calls of other scripts, so the list of commands can be represented as a tree. Above it there are buttons that allow you to editing this tree. You can insert, move, delete and disable scripts.

%html.editor-script%

For each command you need to specify parameters in the card on the right. In addition, the card of each command has [Common settings](common-settings.html) that are the same for all scripts.
