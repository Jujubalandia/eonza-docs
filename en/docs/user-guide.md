# User Guide Overview

This manual describes the main features of the Eonza program, which is designed to create and manage scripts. At startup the program opens its page in the user's browser. By default, the program address is *http://localhost:3234*. If you accidentally close a tab with the program, you do not need to restart it, just open a new tab and specify this URL there. The left vertical panel contains section tabs.

* [**Scripts**](scripts.html). Here you can quickly find the necessary script and then launch it or open it in the editor.
* [**Editor**](editor.html) allows you to create and modify scripts.
* [**Task manager**](task-manager.html) allows you to manage the running scripts, as well as to view the history of launches and the results of completed scripts.
* [**Settings**](settings.html) contain customizable options for working with the program.
